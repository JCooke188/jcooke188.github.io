				<h1> Mission <hr> </h1>
				<p> As a member of an amazing community of academics, my goal is to ensure that the ladder is not pulled up behind us for the future generations of scientists and researchers. 
					I was fortunate to be given an incredible support system during my time as an undergraduate at Pitt through Pitt EXCEL, Pitt Engineering's diversity intiative. Through this initiative, 
					I had many opportunities to make myself a better scholar, but it enabled me to give back to the younger students that followed. I took on 
					leadership roles in the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) Chapter at Pitt, and a group known as B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. The latter group was created to help underrepresented minority 
					men in engineering improve in all facets of life, and provide a space for positive discussion where we could learn from each other's unique experiences.
					At Penn, I continued my involvement with SHPE, acting as the bridge between Hispanic graduate students and undergraduates, facilitating communication, and fostering a community to inspire future 
					researchers. I took on mentorship roles to the undergraduate leaders, helping them navigate the challenges of taking on extracurricular leadership positions while being a student. 
					<br><br>
					As I continue in Academia, I plan to commit myself to the advancement of those that follow in the footsteps of the current generation. I was afforded many opportunities to get to where I am, and I 
					believe it is my responsibility to help those who come after me. I will continue to serve in mentorship roles and actively aid in recruiting students who encompass a range of backgrounds, 
					offering fresh perspectives to the problems we aim to solve. We who have made it this far owe it to the future scientists and engineers to pass on the teachings and wisdom bestowed 
					upon us by our mentors, ensuring the path remains as accessible, if not more so, for them.
