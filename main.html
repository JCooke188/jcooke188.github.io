		<h1> About Me</h1>
		<p> I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Rhode Island's <a href="https://web.uri.edu/gso/">Graduate School of Oceanography.</a> 
		My funding comes from the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/understanding-gulf-ocean-systems-grants">Understanding Gulf Ocean Systems (UGOS) Grant</a>, 
		where I will assist in furthering our understanding of the Loop Current System with numerical modeling.
		<br> <br>
		I received my Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in the <a href="https://www.me.upenn.edu/">Mechanical 
		Engineering and Applied Mechanics Department</a>, under the supervision of Dr. George Ilhwan Park, and much help from my committee members: Dr. Doug Jerolmack and Dr. Paulo Arratia. 
		My research focused on using large-eddy simulation to understand how surface roughness
		changed the physical mechanisms associated with improving aerodynamic efficiency at low Reynolds numbers, and influenced the structure of turbulence within the internal boundary layer at
		very high Reynolds numbers.
		<br> <br>
		I completed my BS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh in 2018 and conducted research under 
		Dr. Hessam Babaee, whom I owe a great deal to for 
		introducing me to the world of CFD, and encouraging me to pursue a graduate education.  
		<br> <br>
		I grew up just outside Boston, MA, and am an avid Boston sports fan.  While growing up I enjoyed playing hockey, football, and baseball, and I still enjoy watching 
		them today. In my free time, I spend time with my better half and our toy Australian Sheperd. I enjoy going to the gym, cooking and eating new foods, and when I can, traveling to new places.
