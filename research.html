				<h2> Research Interests <hr> </h2>
				<p> My primary area of interest lies at the intersection of turbulence and geophysical flows. I employ numerical modeling to aid in 
				understanding the physics of the world around us, and aim to apply my knowledge to help improve the quality of life of those that reside there.  </p>

				<h2> Past Projects <hr> </h2>
					<h3> Internal Boundary Layers </h3>
				<p> I investigated the development of an internal boundary layer (IBL) encoutnering a roughness transition within an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) at White Sands 
					National Park in New Mexico, USA, using wall-modeled large-eddy simulation. This study led to the discovery of a self-similarity of the structure 
					of turbulence in IBLs, as the new length-scales of the flow are dictated by the IBLs growth. This work was published in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2320216121">PNAS</a>. 
					<br><br>
					In a follow-up to this work, I investigated how these changes to turbulence influenced sweep and ejection events through an expanded quandrant analysis, with 
					consequences for sediment transport, and ultimately, the formation and migration of the dunes which influence the flow. This work is currently under review, 
					but a preprint is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05163">here</a>.
					<br><br> 
					As this work was completed within the context of an ABL, much of the near-wall information was unavailable due to the high Reynolds number. 
					So, using available experimental datasets of smooth-to-rough, rough-to-smooth, and rough-to-rougher (and vice versa), a study was conducted to gauge the universality 
					of this IBL-based scaling. From the data, I determined the length- and velocity-scales 
					formed by the developing IBL allow for the collapse of mean velocity and velocity defect profiles within. This work is currently in preparation to be submitted.

					<h3> Low Reynolds Number Aerodynamics </h3>
				<p> I conducted research on the influence of surface roughness on propellers desigend for low Reynolds number flows, to be applied to micro aerial
					vehicle (MAV) flight. Using a large-eddy simulation flow solver, we determined the surface roughness enhances the vortex structures, particularly the 
					leading-edge vortex (LEV). The LEV is known to augment lift at low Reynolds numbers, and this was reflected by an increase in thrust coefficient for the 
					rough propeller, compared to a baseline smooth propeller. This work was published in <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/35/11/113607/2923489">Physics of Fluids</a>.
